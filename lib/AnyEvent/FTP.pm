# ABSTRACT: Simple asynchronous FTP client and server
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # For the client
 use AnyEvent::FTP::Client;

 # For the server
 use AnyEvent::FTP::Server;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution provides client and server implementations for
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in an AnyEvent environment.  For the
specific interfaces, see L<AnyEvent::FTP::Client> and L<AnyEvent::FTP::Server>
for details.

Before each release, L<AnyEvent::FTP::Client> is tested against these FTP servers
using the C<t/client_*.t> tests that come with this distribution:

=over 4

=item Proftpd

=item wu-ftpd

=item L<Net::FTPServer>

=item vsftpd

=item Pure-FTPd

=item bftpd

=item L<AnyEvent::FTP::Server>

=back

The client code is also tested less frequently against these FTP servers:

=over 4

=item NcFTPd

=item Microsoft IIS

=back

It used to also be tested against the VMS ftp server, so it was verified to
work with it, at least at one point. However, I no longer have access to that
server.

=head1 BUNDLED FILES

This distribution comes bundled with C<ls> from the old
L<Perl Power Tools|https://metacpan.org/release/ppt> project.
This is only used on C<MSWin32> if this command is not found in
the path, as it is frequently not available on that platform

The Perl implementation of C<ls>
was written by Mark Leighton Fisher of Thomson Consumer Electronics,
I<fisherm@tce.com>.

That program is free and open software. You may use, modify,
distribute, and sell it program (and any modified variants) in any
way you wish, provided you do not restrict others from doing the same.
