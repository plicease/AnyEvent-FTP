# ABSTRACT: Simple asynchronous ftp server
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use AnyEvent;
 use AnyEvent::FTP::Server;
 
 my $server = AnyEvent::FTP::Server->new;
 $server->start;
 AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<CAUTION> L<AnyEvent::FTP::Server> hasn't been audited by anyone, including
its author, in order to ensure that it is secure.  It is intended to be used
primarily in testing the companion client L<AnyEvent::FTP::Client>.  It can
also be used to write your own context or personality (to use the L<Net::FTPServer>
terminology) that use alternate back ends (say a database or memory store)
that could theoretically be made to be secure, but you will need to carefully
vett both the L<AnyEvent::FTP::Server> code as well as your own customizations
before you deploy on the Internet or on an untrusted network.

This class is used for L<AnyEvent::FTP> server instances.
Each time a client connects to the server a L<AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Connection>
instance is created to manage the TCP connection.  Each connection
also has a L<AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context> which defines the behavior or
personality of the server, and each context instance keeps track of the
current directory, user authentication and authorization status of each
connected client.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 hostname

 my $hostname = $server->hostname;

Readonly, and should be assigned at the constructor. The hostname to listen
on.

=cut

has hostname => (
  is       => 'ro',
);

=head2 port

 my $port = $server->port;

The port to listen to. Default is 21 - a different port can be assigned
at the constructor.

=cut

has port => (
  is      => 'ro',
  default => sub { 21 },
);

=head2 default_context

 my $context = $server->default_context;

Readonly: the default context class (can be set as a parameter in the
constructor).

=cut

has default_context => (
  is      => 'ro',
  default => sub { 'AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context::FSRW' },
);

=head2 welcome

 my($code, $message) = @{ $server->welcome };

The welcome messages as key value pairs. Read only and can be overridden by
the constructor.

=cut

has welcome => (
  is      => 'ro',
  default => sub { [ 220 => "aeftpd $AnyEvent::FTP::Server::VERSION" ] },
);

=head2 bindport

 my $port = $server->bindport;
 $server->bindport($port);

Retrieves or sets the TCP port to bind to.

=cut

has bindport => (
  is => 'rw',
);

=head2 inet

 my $bool = $server->inet;

Readonly (assignable via the constructor). If true, then assume a TCP
connection has been established by inet. The default (false) is to start
a standalone server.

=cut

has inet => (
  is      => 'ro',
  default => sub { 0 },
);

sub BUILD
{
  eval 'use ' . shift->default_context;
  die $@ if $@;
}

=head1 METHODS

=head2 start

 $server->start;

Call this method to start the service.
