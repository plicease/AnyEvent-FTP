# ABSTRACT: Authentication role for FTP server
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your context:

 package AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context::MyContext;
 
 use Moo;
 extends 'AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context';
 with 'AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Role::Auth';
 
 has '+unauthenticated_safe_commands' => (
   default => sub { [ qw( USER PASS HELP QUIT FOO ) ] },
 );
 
 # this command is deemed safe pre auth by
 # unauthenticated_safe_commands
 sub cmd_foo
 {
   my($self, $con, $req) = @_;
   $con->send_response(211 => 'Here to stay');
   $self->done;
 }
 
 # this command can pnly be executed after
 # authentication
 sub cmd_bar
 {
   my($self, $con, $req) = @_;
   $con->send_response(211 => 'And another thing');
   $self->done;
 }

Then when you create your server object:

 use AnyEvent:FTP::Server;
 
 my $server = AnyEvent::FTP::Server->new;
 $server->on_connect(sub {
   # $con isa AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Connection
   my $con = shift;
   # $context isa AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context::MyContext
   my $context = $con->context;
 
   # allow login from user 'user' with password 'secret'
   $context->authenticator(sub {
     my($user, $pass) = @_;
     return $user eq 'user' && $pass eq 'secret';
   });
 
   # make the client wait 5 seconds if they enter a
   # bad username / password
   $context->bad_authentication_delay(5);
 });
